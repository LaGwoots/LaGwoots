- 👋 Hi, I’m @LaGwoots
- 👀 I am a mechanical engineer out of Virginia Commonwealth University, with a mild background in computer science (self-taught)
- 🌱 I’m currently teaching myself more advanced python code, as well as C++, for both game design and functional projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, as long as there is some type of hazard we are dealing with 
- 📫 My email is gbuchanan529@gmail.com, but if you spam me, you will simply become spam yourself.
